Begineerscode.com is a tutorial website for C, C++ and Java. However it has not been hosted online and the domain name does not exist and if does, has no relation with this repository.

This is a sample website created by me and two other friends for a web devlopment contest held in our college.
The tutorials have not been updated and are insufficient for practical use. The main focus was on developing the structure of the website.

TO-DO:

After downloading the repository you can run the website by opening "index.html" file in either the Firefox or Chrome.
